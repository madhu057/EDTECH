<p><strong><em>Mr Pradeep Tomar, Physics HOD at Gyans Bharti School says:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;“The biggest challenge we face with students many a times is on how to improve their scores on long form answers. These charts provided by Educart are extremely useful to analyse where marks are normally deducted. I think this is a very useful resource book that every CBSE student should have and teachers should refer”</em></p>
